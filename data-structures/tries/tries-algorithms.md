# Tries Algorithms

### Offline Queries
"Offline queries" refers to a scenario in which you have a fixed set of queries, and you can process them all at once without the need
for immediate responses. So you can change the order of queries while solving the problem and after processing them all, reindex
and return the result as required.

In contrast, "online queries" would involve processing queries one at a time and responding immediately after each query. 
Offline processing allows for potential optimizations since you can analyze the entire set of queries collectively and implement
more efficient algorithms or data structures.
