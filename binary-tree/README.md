# Binary Tree

A binary tree is a tree in which each node has between 0-2 children. They’re called the left and right children of the node. 
The figure below shows what a Binary Tree looks like.

### Types of Binary Trees
#### Complete Binary Trees
- A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which all the levels of the tree are fully filled, except for perhaps the last level which can be filled from left to right.

#### Full Binary Trees
- In a full or ‘proper’ binary tree, every node has 0 or 2 children. No node can have 1 child.
- The total number of nodes in a full binary tree of height ‘h’ can be expressed as: 2h+1 <= total no of node <= 2^(h+1) - 1

#### Perfect Binary Trees
A Binary tree is said to be Perfect if all its internal nodes have two children and all leaves are at the same level. 
- the total number of nodes in a perfect binary tree of height ‘h’ are given as: 2^(h+1) - 1
- total number of leaf nodes are given as 2^h or (n+1)/2
