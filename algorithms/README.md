## Algorithmic Paradigms

### Brute Force
- This method requires us to go through all the possibilities to find a solution to the problem we want to solve. For instance, if we have a list of integers and we want to find the minimum, maximum, or a certain element in that list, the Brute Force approach requires us to go through all the elements to find that specific element.

- ex: linear search

### Greedy Algorithms
- Greedy is an algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution, piece by piece. This means it chooses the next piece that offers the most obvious and immediate benefit. A Greedy algorithm, as the name implies, always makes the choice that seems to be the best at the time. It makes a locally-optimal choice in the hope that it will lead to a globally optimal solution.
- If you have a problem where the locally-optimal choice leads to a global solution, the best fit is the Greedy technique.

- The Greedy method can solve a problem that satisfies the below-mentioned properties:
  - Greedy choice property: A global optimum can be arrived at by selecting a local optimum.
  - Optimal substructure: An optimal solution to the complete problem contains an optimal solution to subproblems.
- ex: Find the largest path

### Divide and Conquer
- Divide and conquer is an algorithmic paradigm in which the problem is repeatedly divided into subproblems until we reach a point where each problem is similar and atomic (i.e., canâ€™t be further divided).
- It contains 3 steps
  - Divide
  - Conquer
  - Merge
