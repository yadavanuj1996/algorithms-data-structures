Algorithm Summary:

1. **Create a dictionary `phone_dict`** that maps each digit to the corresponding letters on a phone keypad.
2. 
3. **Initialize an empty list `result`** to store the generated combinations.
4. 
5. **Define a recursive function `letter_combinations`** that takes two parameters: `index` and `cur_seq`. 
    - `index` represents the current index in the digits string.
    - `cur_seq` represents the current combination being generated.
    
    Within the `letter_combinations` function:
    - Check if the current index (`index`) is equal to the length of the digits string (`n`). 
        - If so, it means all digits have been processed, and the current combination (`cur_seq`) is complete. Append it to the `result` list.
    - Iterate through the letters corresponding to the digit at the current index, obtained from the `phone_dict`.
    - Recursively call `letter_combinations` with the incremented `index` and the updated `cur_seq` by appending the current letter.

6. **Call `letter_combinations`** with initial parameters `index=0` and `cur_seq=""`.

7. **Return the `result` list** containing all the generated combinations.
