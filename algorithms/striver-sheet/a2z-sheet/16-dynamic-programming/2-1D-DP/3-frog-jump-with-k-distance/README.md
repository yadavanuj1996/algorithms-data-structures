## minimizeCost Algorithm

The `minimizeCost` function calculates the minimum energy required for a frog to jump to the last stone, given an array of stone heights and the maximum number of stones the frog can jump over at once.

### Algorithm

1. **Initialization:**
   - Create a memoization array `memo` of size `n` initialized with `-1` to store the minimum energy required to reach each stone.

2. **Recursive Function (`min_energy_req`):**
   - Base cases:
     - If the frog is already on the first stone (`n == 0`), the energy required is `0`.
     - If the energy required to reach the current stone is already calculated (`memo[n] != -1`), return the stored value.
     - If the frog is on the second stone (`n == 1`), calculate the energy required and store it in `memo[1]`.
   - Recursively calculate the minimum energy required to reach the current stone by considering all possible jumps from previous stones within the allowed range (up to `k` stones).

3. **Result:**
   - The minimum energy required to reach the last stone is stored in `memo[n-1]`.

### Code

```python
from typing import *

def minimizeCost(n: int, k: int, heights: List[int]) -> int:
    memo = [-1] * n

    def min_energy_req(n):
        if n == 0:
            return 0
        
        if memo[n] != -1:
            return memo[n]

        if n == 1:
            memo[1] = abs(heights[1] - heights[0])
            return memo[1]
        
        minimum = float("inf")

        for i in range(1, k + 1):
            if n - i >= 0:
                val = abs(heights[n] - heights[n - i]) + min_energy_req(n - i)
                minimum = min(minimum, val)
        
        memo[n] = minimum
        return memo[n]
    
    return min_energy_req(n - 1)
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is **O(n * k)**. Each stone requires checking up to `k` previous stones, and this check is performed for all `n` stones.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity of this algorithm is **O(n)** due to the memoization array `memo` used to store the minimum energy required to reach each stone.
