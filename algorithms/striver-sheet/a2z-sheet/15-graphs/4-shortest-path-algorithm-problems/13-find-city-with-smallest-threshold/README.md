## Algorithm Summary

1. **Initialize Distance Matrix**:
   - Create a 2D array `dist_matrix` representing the distances between nodes.
   - Initialize all values to infinity to signify that no direct connections exist initially.
   
2. **Set Self-Referencing Distances**:
   - Iterate through each node in the network.
   - Set the distance of each node to itself as 0 in the `dist_matrix`, as it takes no distance to reach itself.
   
3. **Set Direct Edges Distances**:
   - Iterate through the list of edges.
   - For each edge `(s_node, d_node, weight)`, update the `dist_matrix` with the weight of the edge between `s_node` and `d_node`.
   - Since the graph is undirected, update both `dist_matrix[s_node][d_node]` and `dist_matrix[d_node][s_node]`.
   
4. **Calculate Shortest Paths** (Floyd-Warshall Algorithm):
   - Iterate through each node in the network as a potential intermediate node (`via_node`).
   - For each pair of nodes `(s_node, d_node)`, update the distance between them in `dist_matrix` considering the intermediate node.
   - Update the distance as the minimum of:
     - The current distance between `s_node` and `d_node`.
     - The sum of the distances between `s_node` and `via_node` and `via_node` and `d_node`.
     
5. **Count Adjacent Cities**:
   - Iterate through each source node (`s_node`) in the network.
   - For each destination node (`d_node`), count the number of adjacent cities within the distance threshold.
   - Increment a counter `count_of_adj_cities` for each adjacent city within the threshold.
   
6. **Find City with Minimum Adjacent Cities**:
   - Initialize variables `city_node` and `adj_city_count` to keep track of the city with the minimum number of adjacent cities and its count.
   - Iterate through each node (`s_node`) in the network.
   - Calculate the count of adjacent cities for the current `s_node`.
   - If the count of adjacent cities is less than or equal to the current minimum count (`adj_city_count`), update `city_node` and `adj_city_count` accordingly.
   
7. **Return Result**:
   - After iterating through all nodes, return the index of the city (`city_node`) with the minimum count of adjacent cities within the distance threshold.
