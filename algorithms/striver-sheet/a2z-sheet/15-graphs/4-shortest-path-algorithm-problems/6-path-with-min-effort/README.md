This algorithm finds the minimum effort path in a grid of heights using Dijkstra's algorithm. Here's a summary:

1. **Initialize variables:**
   - Initialize the distance matrix with infinity for all cells.
   - Create a priority queue to store tuples of `(absolute_difference, (row, col))` where `absolute_difference` is the maximum absolute difference in height encountered so far and `(row, col)` represents the cell coordinates.
   - Initialize the priority queue with `(0, (0, 0))`, indicating starting from the top-left corner.

2. **While the priority queue is not empty:**
   - Pop the tuple with the smallest `absolute_difference` from the priority queue.
   - For each of the four adjacent cells:
     - Calculate the next `absolute_difference` as the maximum of the current `absolute_difference` and the absolute difference in heights between the current cell and the adjacent cell.
     - If the calculated `absolute_difference` is less than the `absolute_difference` stored in the `dist` matrix for the adjacent cell, update the `dist` matrix and push the tuple `(next_absolute_difference, (row, col))` into the priority queue.

3. **Once the priority queue is empty or the target cell `(no_of_rows-1, no_of_cols-1)` is reached:**
   - Return the `absolute_difference` stored in the `dist` matrix at the target cell if it's not infinity, otherwise return 0.

This algorithm efficiently finds the minimum effort path by considering the maximum difference in height encountered along the path.
