- **Getting Started**:
  - First, we convert the list of words into a set called `wordSet`.
  - Then, we create an empty queue to store our exploration.
  - We check if the `endWord` exists in our set of words. If not, we return 0.
  - We start our exploration by adding the `beginWord` to the queue along with a count of 1.

- **Exploration Process**:
  - While there are still words in our queue:
    - We take out a word and its associated count from the queue.
    - If this word matches the `endWord`, we return the count as our answer.
    - Otherwise, we go through each letter in the word.

- **Generating Options**:
  - For each letter in the word:
    - We try replacing it with every letter from 'a' to 'z'.
    - If the new word exists in our set of words:
      - We add it to our queue along with an incremented count.
      - We also remove this word from our set to avoid repetition.

- **Finishing Up**:
  - If we exhaust all possible transformations without finding the `endWord`, we return 0.
