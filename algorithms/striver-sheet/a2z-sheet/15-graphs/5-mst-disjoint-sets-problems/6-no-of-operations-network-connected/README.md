This Python solution tackles the challenge of determining whether it's feasible to connect all nodes in a network by removing some edges. Here's a breakdown of the algorithm:

1. **Initialization**: The algorithm initializes two arrays:
   - `parent`: A list representing the parent nodes of each node in the network, initially set to contain node indices.
   - `rank`: A list storing the rank of each node's tree for union by rank, initialized with zeros.

2. **Ultimate Parent Determination**: It defines a recursive function `get_ultimate_parent(node)` to find the ultimate parent of a node. The function utilizes path compression by updating the parent of each traversed node directly to the ultimate parent for efficient retrieval.

3. **Union by Rank**: Another function `union_by_rank(u, v)` performs union by rank, ensuring that the shorter tree is attached to the root of the taller tree to maintain balance. It compares the ranks of the ultimate parents of the given nodes `u` and `v` and adjusts the parent pointers accordingly.

4. **Edge Processing**: The algorithm iterates through the given connections. For each edge, represented as `(u, v)`, it checks whether the ultimate parents of nodes `u` and `v` are already the same, indicating that they are connected. If not, it connects them using `union_by_rank(u, v)`.

5. **Component Counting**: After processing all connections, the algorithm counts the number of components in the network. It does so by iterating over each node and identifying nodes whose ultimate parent is themselves, indicating they are the roots of separate components.

6. **Extra Edges Counting**: It calculates the number of extra edges present in the network. These are edges that connect nodes already connected within the same component.

7. **Edge Requirement Calculation**: If the number of extra edges is greater than or equal to the number of components minus one, there are enough edges to connect all components except one. Thus, it returns the count of required edges to complete the network. Otherwise, it returns -1 to signify that it's not feasible to connect all nodes.

This algorithm efficiently manages node connections in a network while considering edge constraints, ensuring optimal connectivity and component integrity.
