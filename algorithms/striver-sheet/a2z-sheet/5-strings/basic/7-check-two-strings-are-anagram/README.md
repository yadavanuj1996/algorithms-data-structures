## Algorithm Summary

### Method
1. Check if the lengths of strings `s` and `t` are equal. If not, return `False`, as strings of different lengths cannot be anagrams.
2. Initialize two dictionaries, `s_freq` and `t_freq`, to store the frequency of characters in strings `s` and `t`, respectively.
3. Iterate over each character `ch` in string `s`:
    - If `ch` is already a key in the dictionary `s_freq`, increment its value by 1; otherwise, set its value to 1.
4. Iterate over each character `ch` in string `t`:
    - If `ch` is already a key in the dictionary `t_freq`, increment its value by 1; otherwise, set its value to 1.
5. Check if the dictionaries `s_freq` and `t_freq` are equal. If they are equal, return `True`; otherwise, return `False`.
