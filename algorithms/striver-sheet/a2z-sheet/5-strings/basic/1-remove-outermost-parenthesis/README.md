## Algorithm Summary: Remove Outermost Parentheses

### Problem Statement:
Given a string `s` representing a valid parentheses string, remove the outermost parentheses of every primitive string in the primitive decomposition of `s`.

### Algorithm Steps:
1. Initialize `count` to keep track of the nesting level of parentheses and `result` to store the modified string.
2. Iterate through each character `ch` in the input string `s`.
3. For each character `ch`, do the following:
   - If `ch` is an opening parenthesis "(" and `count` is 0 (indicating the outermost opening parenthesis), increment `count`.
   - If `ch` is an opening parenthesis "(" and `count` is greater than 0 (indicating nested parentheses), append `ch` to the `result` and increment `count`.
   - If `ch` is a closing parenthesis ")" and `count` is 1 (indicating the outermost closing parenthesis), decrement `count`.
   - If `ch` is a closing parenthesis ")" and `count` is greater than 1 (indicating nested parentheses), append `ch` to the `result` and decrement `count`.
4. After iterating through all characters, return the `result`.

### Example:
Input: s = "(()())(())"
Output: "()()()"

Explanation:
The primitive decomposition of the string "(()())(())" is "(()())" + "(())".
The outermost parentheses of each primitive string are removed, resulting in "()()" + "()".
The final output string is "()()()".
