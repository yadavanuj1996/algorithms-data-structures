- Define a class `Solution` with a method `jump` that takes a list of integers `nums` as input and returns an integer.
- Initialize variables `n`, `s_ind`, `e_ind`, and `steps` to store the length of the input list, start index, end index, and number of steps respectively.
- Iterate using a while loop until the `e_ind` reaches or exceeds the last index of the list.

- Within the while loop, initialize `e_next_ind` to -1.
- Iterate through the sublist of `nums` from `s_ind` to `e_ind`, inclusive, using a for loop.
- Update `e_next_ind` to the maximum reachable index from the current position in the sublist.
- Update `s_ind` to `e_ind + 1` and `e_ind` to `e_next_ind`.
- Increment `steps` by 1.
- Return the number of steps once the while loop exits.
