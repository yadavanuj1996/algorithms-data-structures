**Algorithm Summary:**

1. Initialize a pointer `cur_node` to the head of the linked list.
2. Iterate through the linked list.
3. If the current node is the head node and its data matches the target value `k`, move the head pointer to the next node.
4. If the current node's data matches `k`, adjust the pointers to remove the node from the linked list.
5. Continue iterating until the end of the linked list is reached.
6. Return the updated head pointer.
