**Algorithm Summary** (Optimized Approach)
- Start with two pointers at the heads of the linked lists.
- Traverse both lists simultaneously.
- If one pointer reaches the end of a list, redirect it to the head of the **other** list.
- Continue until both pointers meet at an intersection or reach the end of both lists.
- Return the intersection node if found, otherwise return None.
