## Algorithm:

1. **Start:** Begin with some initial setup.
2. **Loop Through Lists:** Go through both lists until there's no more to add or carry.
3. **During Each Step:**
   - Find the sum and manage any carrying over.
   - Create a new number for the result list.
   - Update the result list and move to the next numbers.
4. **Finish Loop:** Once done, give back the result list.
