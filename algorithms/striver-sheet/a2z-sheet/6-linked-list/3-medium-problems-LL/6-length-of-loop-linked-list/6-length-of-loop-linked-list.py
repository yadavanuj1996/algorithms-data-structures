Find length of Loop

Problem Link:
https://www.codingninjas.com/studio/problems/find-length-of-loop_8160455

Statement
Youâ€™re given a linked list. The last node might point to null, or it might point to a node in the list,
thus forming a cycle.
Find out whether the linked list has a cycle or not, and the length of the cycle if it does.
If there is no cycle, return 0, otherwise return the length of the cycle.


Constraints:
- 1 <= n <= 100000
- 1 <= Data in linked list node <= 10^9
- 0 <= p <= n

Test Case:

Input: 
4
4 10 3 5
2

Output: 
3
