Rotting Oranges

Problem Link:
https://leetcode.com/problems/rotting-oranges/

Statement:
You are given an m x n grid where each cell can have one of three values:

0 representing an empty cell,
1 representing a fresh orange, or
2 representing a rotten orange.
Every minute, any fresh orange that is 4-directionally adjacent to a rotten orange becomes rotten.

Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange. If this is impossible,
return -1.

Constraints:
- m == grid.length
- n == grid[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 10
- grid[i][j] is 0, 1, or 2.

Test Case:

Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]
Output: 4

"""
"""
Time Complexity: O(m*n), Reason: Worst-case â€“ We will be making each fresh orange rotten in the grid and for each rotten orange will check in 4 directions
Space Complexity: O(m*n), visited has m*n size or if all oranges are Rotten, we will end up pushing all rotten oranges into the Queue data structure
