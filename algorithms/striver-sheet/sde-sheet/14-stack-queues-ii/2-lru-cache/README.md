Approach 2:
Using a OrderedDict (Collection module), the OrderedDict make sure that the element is always stored in order
in which they are inserted.

- popitem() will remove the last in item of ordereddict while popitem(last=False) will remove first item(the one that is inserted first)

Approach 1: Using Doubly Linked List and Dict (put and get in O(1) or constant time complexity
