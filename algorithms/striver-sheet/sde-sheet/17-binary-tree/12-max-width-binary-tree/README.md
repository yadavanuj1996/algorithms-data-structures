Sure, here's the README section for your algorithm, revised to be more programmer and human-friendly, while including your code:


# Binary Tree Maximum Width Algorithm

## Algorithm Summary

The algorithm calculates the maximum width of a binary tree. The width of a binary tree is defined as the maximum number of nodes present at any level. This is accomplished by using a breadth-first search (BFS) approach with a queue, which helps to keep track of the position of nodes at each level.

### Steps:
1. **Initialize the Queue**: Use a deque to store pairs of nodes and their corresponding serial numbers. The serial number represents the position of the node if the level were fully populated (starting from 0).
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Perform BFS on the tree level by level.
    - For each node at the current level, calculate its left and right children's serial numbers and add them to the queue.
    - Track the minimum and maximum serial numbers at each level.
3. **Calculate Width**: For each level, compute the width by subtracting the minimum serial number from the maximum serial number and adding one.
4. **Update Maximum Width**: Keep track of the maximum width encountered across all levels.
5. **Return Result**: Finally, return the maximum width.

### Detailed Steps to Calculate Serial Numbers:
- For a given node with serial number `s_no`:
  - The left child's serial number is `2 * s_no`.
  - The right child's serial number is `2 * s_no + 1`.

### Code:
```python
from collections import deque

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def widthOfBinaryTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        # node, s_no
        # s_no is the horizontal serial number of a node at the current level i.e., 
        # if all nodes are filled at the current level and we move from left to right 
        # (starting from 0), what will be the serial number of the current node
        queue = deque([(root, 0)])
        res = 0
        
        while queue:
            min_s_no, max_s_no = None, None
            size = len(queue)  # represents the number of nodes at the current level
            for _ in range(size):
                cur_node, s_no = queue.popleft()
                #print(cur_node.val, s_no)
                min_s_no = s_no if (min_s_no is None) or (s_no < min_s_no) else min_s_no
                max_s_no = s_no if (max_s_no is None) or (s_no > max_s_no) else max_s_no
                
                if cur_node.left:
                    queue.append((cur_node.left, s_no * 2))

                if cur_node.right:
                    queue.append((cur_node.right, s_no * 2 + 1))
        
            level_res = max_s_no - min_s_no + 1
            res = max(res, level_res)

        return res
```

### Time Complexity
- **O(N)**: Each node is processed exactly once, where \(N\) is the total number of nodes in the tree.

### Space Complexity
- **O(N)**: In the worst case, the queue could hold all the nodes at the deepest level of the tree, which could be up to \(N/2\) nodes in a complete binary tree.

## Explanation

This algorithm effectively leverages the properties of a queue and the concept of serial numbers to track the horizontal 
positions of nodes. By calculating the width at each level and updating the maximum width, the algorithm ensures an
efficient traversal and width calculation for the binary tree. The calculation of left and right children's serial numbers 
ensures accurate placement and tracking of nodes across levels.
