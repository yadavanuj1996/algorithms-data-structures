### Algorithm Summary: Diameter of Binary Tree

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in the tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

The algorithm to find the diameter involves the following steps:

1. **Recursive Height Calculation:**
   - Create a helper function `get_height` that computes the height of the left and right subtrees for each node.
   - While calculating the height, also compute the diameter at each node, which is the sum of the heights of the left and right subtrees.

2. **Update Maximum Diameter:**
   - Maintain a list `max_dia` with a single element to store the maximum diameter found during the traversal.
   - Update `max_dia[0]` with the maximum of its current value and the diameter at the current node.

3. **Base Case for Recursion:**
   - If the current node is `None`, return a height of 0.

4. **Recursive Case:**
   - Compute the left and right subtree heights.
   - Update the maximum diameter using the current node's left and right subtree heights.
   - Return the height of the current node as `1 + max(left_height, right_height)`.

5. **Initiate the Recursive Function:**
   - Call the `get_height` function with the root of the binary tree to start the process.
   - The final result is stored in `max_dia[0]`.


### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity:** \( O(n) \)
  - The tree is traversed once to calculate heights and diameters.
  
- **Space Complexity:** \( O(n) \)
  - In the worst case, the recursive call stack will store all nodes (in the case of a skewed tree).

This algorithm ensures an efficient computation of the tree's diameter by leveraging a single post-order traversal.
