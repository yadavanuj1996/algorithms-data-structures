### Greedy Algorithms
- Greedy is an algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution, piece by piece. This means it chooses the next piece that offers the most obvious and immediate benefit. A Greedy algorithm, as the name implies, always makes the choice that seems to be the best at the time. It makes a locally-optimal choice in the hope that it will lead to a globally optimal solution.
- If you have a problem where the locally-optimal choice leads to a global solution, the best fit is the Greedy technique.

- The Greedy method can solve a problem that satisfies the below-mentioned properties:
  - Greedy choice property: A global optimum can be arrived at by selecting a local optimum.
  - Optimal substructure: An optimal solution to the complete problem contains an optimal solution to subproblems.

Type of Problems:
- Max Profit / Deadline problems
- Fractional Knapsack problem
- N meetings in one room
- Jump to end of stair case problem
- Insert/ Merge Intervals
