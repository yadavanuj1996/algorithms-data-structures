# Recursion


## How to Identify a recurstion problem?
When we see a problem, it is very important to identify it as a recursion problem. 
Generally (but not limited to) if the problem statement asks for the following:

- To find subsequences (Find all the subsequence, unique subsequence, subsequence with sum)
- Combination of array type problems


### Pick and not pick technique for recursion problems (used in DP as well)
