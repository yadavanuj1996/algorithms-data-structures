# Recursion


## How to Identify a recurstion problem?
When we see a problem, it is very important to identify it as a recursion problem. 
Generally (but not limited to) if the problem statement asks for the following:

- To find subsequences (Find all the subsequence, unique subsequence, subsequence with sum)
- Combination of array type problems


### Pick and not pick technique for recursion problems (used in DP as well)

### Pick and not pick technique for recursion problems that need to find whether a subset contains a sum or not
In this we simply need to find whether a subset contains a sum or not i.e., true or false then we use a varied form of
pick and unpick
